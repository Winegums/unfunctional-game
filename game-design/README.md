## Game Design Document

### LEVELS
- A bad puzzle for just starting the game using shitty menus?
- Audio/Video Settings Menu Puzzle
- clipping through first door
- Quicktime events to door
- email support door (setup and send an email)
- long run distance door (reference all walking simulators), add stamina bar mechanics
- 2nd Person shooter door, fight dumb AI but camera view is from their perspective of you
- dlc door, open a fake shop page
- bad RNG door
- dumb NPC conversation
- FPS but the every aim gun throws your aim somewhere random
- over achiever, constant achievement abuse level
- compass following task level (constantly collowing compass and paths)
- item degradation level (you use items but they immediately break before you finish each task)


#### TODO
- game-design: finalize level descriptions and order of levels
- planning: breakdown development components for first 3 levels
- design: moodboard and color pallette
- design: add references and pulls to `reference-design` dir

#### DONE


## LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS

### LEVEL1
A stupidly confusing MainMenu UI system, difficult to find the `Start Game` button

### LEVEL2
An obscene amount of audio/video adjustment steps:
- brightness
- contrast
- left screen tear
- right screen tear
- top screen tear
- bottom screan tear
- left channel audio
- right channel audio
- poor threshold compression parameter
- visual effect adjustment for particles/fog (that barely exist)

### LEVEL3
A simple room as per our design aesthetic, door doesn't directly open but instead requires a wall clip glitch

### LEVEL4
