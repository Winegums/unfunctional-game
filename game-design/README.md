## Game Design Document

### LEVELS
- A bad puzzle for just starting the game using shitty menus?
- Audio/Video Settings Menu Puzzle
- clipping through first door
- Quicktime events to door
- email support door (setup and send an email)
- long run distance door (reference all walking simulators)
- 2nd Person shooter door, fight dumb AI but camera view is from their perspective of you
- dlc door, open a fake shop page
- bad RNG door
- dumb NPC conversation
- FPS but the every aim gun throws your aim somewhere random


#### TODO
- game-design: finalize level descriptions and order of levels
- planning: breakdown development components for first 3 levels
- design: moodboard and color pallette
- design: add references and pulls to `reference-design` dir

#### DONE
